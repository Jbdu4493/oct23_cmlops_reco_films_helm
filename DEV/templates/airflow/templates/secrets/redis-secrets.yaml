# We will create these secrets (if necessary) _even if_ we aren't
# currently using CeleryExecutor or CeleryKubernetesExecutor. As we are
# relying on the "pre-install" hack to prevent changing randomly generated passwords,
# updating the executor later doesn't give us the opportunity to deploy them
# when we need them. We will always deploy them defensively to make the executor
# update path actually work.
